<p>Hello, I am tef. I'm available for hire. I write computer programs. I’ve been an Architect, an SRE, and a Pen-Tester too.</p>
<p>I’m looking for lead roles in platform engineering.</p>
<p>I'm pretty good at building resilient, large-scale, distributed systems, but mostly what I bring to a job is two decades of unix trivia and a lot of experience with computer failures.</p>
<p>I've written programs in Python, Ruby, Bash, Go, Java, JavaScript for money. I tend to end up working on automation, operations, or platform engineering. I usually work above POSIX and behind HTTP, too.</p>
<p>I wrote an essay, <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend</a>, about how I build systems. More recently, I wrote <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/162346490883/how-do-you-cut-a-monolith-in-half">How do you cut a monolith in half?</a>, on the difficulty of handling state and recovery inside queues.</p>
<p>Email me if you have remote (UK based) roles: <a href="mailto:tef@cv.twentygototen.org">tef@cv.twentygototen.org</a>. American Timezones aren't a problem (I have a circadian rhythm disorder).</p>
<p>(I’m currently not interested in Cassandra or Kafka roles).</p>
<h1 id="abridged-work-history">Abridged Work History</h1>
<p>I spent a lot of time in operations, so a lot of my energy has been spent making sure things <em>didn’t</em> happen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile with programming, my time is spent speeding up other people’s work. Starting with better deployment systems, some bits of documentation, lifting out a good API, and ending with meetings that run to time.</p>
<p>It’s very hard to take credit for the work people built atop yours, but I’m going to try.</p>
<h2 id="lead-infra-engineer-at-heroku-postgres">2014-2016: Lead Infra Engineer at Heroku (Postgres)</h2>
<p>I was on call for over a million databases. I worked on the in-house automation system for the database-as-a-service, in a small, then a large team. I have explained the problems with page fragmentation in PostgreSQL more times than I can remember. I removed a lot of race conditions, (more than I added, at least).</p>
<p>The most substantial piece of code I was responsible for, was a state machine wrapper for recovery processes, that allowed us to write a lot less code and invest in our dashboard &amp; console tooling too.</p>
<p>My lasting impact is probably: useful documentation, pushing the team to bring in juniors, and bringing just enough formality into the weekly meeting that it ran to time, every week.</p>
<h2 id="programmer-at-code-club-childrens-educational-non-profit">2013-2014: Programmer at Code Club (Children's educational non-profit)</h2>
<p>I helped write educational materials for 9-11 year olds across the UK, some of which have been translated and used around the world. I got to teach children how to code at Bletchley park, work with other non-profits, and at one point I ended up dressed up as the Firefox mascot.</p>
<p>My lasting impact is that the course materials were published openly, rather than behind a registration barrier.</p>
<h2 id="architect-at-hanzo-web-archiving">2011-2013: Architect at Hanzo (Web Archiving)</h2>
<p>I got hired four months before a deadline and re-wrote 50% of the product to hit it. I built a distributed headless browser in QtWebkit, Python, and a lot of boilerplate.</p>
<p>My lasting impact was introducing dependency injection, allowing client specific code to be kept away from shared libraries. They had a lot of client specific code.</p>
<h2 id="other-roles-pre-2011">Other roles pre 2011</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>2009-2011, Cloudsoft: A Cloud Services startup. Java. OSGi.</p></li>
<li><p>2008-2009, Skyscanner: Replacing a JScript/VB6/XSLT driven web scraping process with python. Still in use today, but the real impact was being able to write code without editing production systems.</p></li>
<li><p>2007, Securetest: Penetration testing (i.e nmap-to-powerpoint), working on PCI et al compliance, and standard vulnerability testing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>I gave a talk called <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=csyL9EC0S0c">Programming Is Terrible</a>, and it has been surprisingly popular on YouTube.</p>
